Top-Bottom Approach - Recursion + Memoization

Bottom-Up Approach - Tabulation

The two main approaches to dynamic programming are memoization (top-down approach) and tabulation (bottom-up approach). Memoization = Recursion + Caching. Recursion is expensive both in processor time and memory space. In the tabulation approach to DP, we solve all sub-problems and store their results on a matrix.
